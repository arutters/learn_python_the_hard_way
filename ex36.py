# Rules for if-statements
# every if statement must have an else:
# if this else shouldnt run becuase it doesnt make sense, a die function must be included. Itll just print an error message(will find many)
# never test if statments more than two deep and always try to do them one
# treat if statemtns like paragraphs where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set of sentences. put blank lines before and after
# your Boolean test should be simple, if not move their calculations to earlier variables in your function and use a good name for the variable


#Rules for loops
# Use a while-loop only to loop forever(which means never). Only applies to Python
# Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially is there is a fixed or limited number of things to loop over

# Tips for Debugging
# Do NOT use a "debugger" its the equivalent of a full body scan on a sick person. You dont get any specific useful info, and you
# find a lot of info that doesnt help and is just confusing
# The best way to debug is to use print to print out the values of variables in points of the program to see where they go wrong
# Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. Dont write massive files of code before you try to run them.
